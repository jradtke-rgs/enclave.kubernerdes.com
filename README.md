# README

This single repository contains the overview, architecture, and implementation steps to deploy RGS stack on small form factor PC (Intel NUC).

## Status
This is mostly a collection of scripts, notes, etc.. at this point.  It will change significantly to be more of a guide and reference.

[Hardware](./Hardware.md)

# TODO
While this repo is available via HTTP/S, I will make all the content available or sourced from a USB device, and then shared from the nuc-00, to emulate an airgap deploy.
