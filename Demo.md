# Demo Walkthrough


# Prerequisites

| Item | Purpose/Reason |
|:-----|:---------------| 
| VIP | The IP used for Harvester UI |
| IPs | Each node needs an IP address - I prefer to use static |
| DHCP | (optional) |
| DNS | You should have a working DNS environment - we need the IPs of the DNS Servers |
| Harvester Image | You can find the community bits at Github (link below), or pull from Carbide |
| Cloud Images | Download from vendor, or create your own (typically for Windows VMs) |
